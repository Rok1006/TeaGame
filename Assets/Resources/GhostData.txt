Tonight is the night... I hope you are ready.
<p>1
My time is running out.
<p>1
Do you still remember the things I've taught you?
<p>2
Worry not.
<p>0.8
Before I let you off on your own.
<p>1
I'll walk you through it for one last time.
<p>1
This time, remember it with your heart...
<p>2
...If you are determined to take my place... and face them by yourself.
<p>2
Now then... Shall we?
<p>2
Take a look around. But don't touch anything yet.
<p>0.5
Take a deep breath and listen to me.
<p>0.3
You will know what to do once we get there.

Making tea is bringing a river of life to the table. 
<p>6
It can clean but can't be minced.
<p>6
It is the bones and flesh in a cup of tea.
<p>6
<Stage>3
Where the river flows, a trail of greens grows.
<p>6
Though it may look dull, its scent soothes your soul.
<p>6
Its scent reaches farthest when it looks weakest.
<p>6
<Stage>4
Ice breeds no greens.
<p>6
It takes time for ice to turn into rivers.
<p>6
Only rivers breed fine greens.
<p>6
<Stage>5
To grow things on soil, you'll work with a trowel.
<p>6
Without it, no greens will grow even with a river.
<p>6
You trowel the soil to make the tea royal.
<p>6
<Stage>6
It's better in pieces than when it's complete.
<p>6
The harder you try to crush it, the finer it becomes.
<p>6
It's bitter, but that makes it better.
<p>6
<Stage>7
It goes well with a cup of tea.
<p>6
It looks like the moon outside.
<p>6
Even tea can be bitter, but this never is.
