So tired…can’t sleep…
What?...I’m dead?
Oh…I guess that makes sense.
I’m not sure how I should feel about that.
I guess I feel…relieved?
I mean, now, at least, I can rest a bit.
I was always so busy when I was alive.
I never had any time to relax.
I was just working all the time.
Homework, a part time job, the crew team, the debate club…
I never had time to rest.
I never even had time for a cup of tea.
Oh, I wish that I had taken more time to relax and drink some tea.
If I could just have a cup of tea or two, I think I could move on.
